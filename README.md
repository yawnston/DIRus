# DIRus

## Current working build of my File Viewer Pascal project, for my first year Undergrad Programming class

Features include:

-browsing directories, mouse and keyboard(almost) support
-file information(name, date modified, size, file type)
-navigating with:
*address bar for typing known locations
*editing address directly in the addr bar
*clicking through folders
*"UP" button, which takes you up one level (NOTE: this does nothing if you are in a drive directly, such as C:\)
-file previews
*if an image is detected, it displays a small portion of the image
      SUPPORTED IMAGE FILES: png,bmp,jpg,jpeg
*attempts to preview other files as text (this results in interesting things when unsupported files are previewed)
